The chalenge is to identufy which attribute correlates with the price the most, and try to iclude as many categorical attributes as possible. Keeping in mind that some categories as model and region has thousands of unique values. From this preliminary analysis it shows that the way to reach an excellent estimate for a car price is to cluster by manufacturer, and then go allong other properties such as year, number of cylinders, paint color and model."
